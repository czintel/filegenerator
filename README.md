# File generator

This is a demo for a simple CLI tool.

## Use case

When working on a project with React, we often have to create three files for one component. Especially if we test our components and use a styleguide.

For example: `Header.js`, `Header.spec.js`, `Header.stories.js`

Often it is a bit of a tedious task to create all those files with the right setup and starting templates.

`filegenerator` to the rescue!

This tool allows us to simply use the command `filegenerator` in our project shell and generate all three files for the one component we want to build.

## How to use it?

Clone this project, run `npm install` to get started.

To get the `filegenerator` build, run `npm run build`.

To copy `filegenerator` to your `/usr/local/bin` folder, run `npm run copy`.

Go to your react app, open the terminal and write `filegenerator`.

Happy Coding!
